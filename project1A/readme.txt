My calculator realizes the basic calculation fuction,if you correctly enter an expression. "correctly" mainly menas:

1) No special characters like"(", "!" and no letters are acceptable.
2) No zero can be divisor.
3) Operator "-" can be typed before a number to represent a negative number but operator "+" is not supported to, for example, "+2+3" or "2/+3" is treated as invalid expression while "1/-2" can be calculated.
4) No continuous operators are supported, for example, "2++3" is treated as invalid expression.
5) When nothing is input, it will be treated as invalid expression.
